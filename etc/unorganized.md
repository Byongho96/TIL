**How the computer starts, when I press the power button?**

When you press the power button on a computer, it sends an electrical signal to the computer's motherboard, which in turn sends a signal to the computer's power supply unit (PSU) to turn on. The PSU then provides power to the various components of the computer, including the CPU, RAM, and other peripherals.

Once power is supplied to the computer, the system firmware (usually the BIOS or UEFI) takes control and performs a series of hardware tests and initializations, commonly referred to as the Power-On Self Test (POST). The firmware then searches for a bootable device, such as the computer's hard drive, CD/DVD drive, or USB drive, and loads the operating system into memory.

So, in summary, pressing the power button on a computer sends an electrical signal that starts the hardware and firmware initialization process. The operating system is then loaded into memory from a bootable device, such as the computer's hard drive, and begins to run.
