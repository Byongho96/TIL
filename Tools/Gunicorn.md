Gunicorn is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) HTTP server. It is a lightweight server that is used to run Python web applications. Gunicorn is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and scalable.

When a Python web application is developed, it needs a way to communicate with a web server in order to handle requests and responses. Gunicorn acts as a middleman between the web server and the Python application. It receives HTTP requests from the web server, passes them to the Python application for processing, and then returns the response to the web server.

Gunicorn is known for its ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it a good choice for applications that need to handle high traffic. It is also relatively easy to configure and can be used with a variety of web frameworks, such as Flask and Django.

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/django_test /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

The command "sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/django_test /etc/nginx/sites-enabled" creates a symbolic link between the configuration file "django_test" in the "sites-available" directory and the "sites-enabled" directory in the Nginx configuration.

In Nginx, the "sites-available" directory contains the configuration files for all the websites or web applications that Nginx can serve. However, these configuration files are not active by default. The "sites-enabled" directory contains symbolic links to the configuration files that are currently active or enabled.

By running the command "sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/django_test /etc/nginx/sites-enabled", a symbolic link named "django_test" is created in the "sites-enabled" directory, which points to the actual configuration file in the "sites-available" directory. This makes the configuration file active, and Nginx can now serve the website or web application defined in that configuration file.

It's important to note that this command assumes that the file "django_test" exists in the "sites-available" directory and that the Nginx server is installed and running on the system.
