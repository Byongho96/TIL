The PSU then provides power to the various components of the computer, including the CPU, RAM, and other peripherals.</p>\n<p>Once power is supplied to the computer, the system firmware (usually the BIOS or UEFI) takes control and performs a series of hardware tests and initializations, commonly referred to as the Power-On Self Test (POST). The firmware then searches for a bootable device, such as the computer's hard drive, CD/DVD drive, or USB drive, and loads the operating system into memory.</p>\n<p>So, in summary, pressing the power button on a computer sends an electrical signal that starts the hardware and firmware initialization process. The operating system is then loaded into memory from a bootable device, such as the computer's hard drive, and begins to run.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"pagePath":"posts/etc/unorganized.md","id":"47bf0fe5-1e2f-5a39-9fe1-e3eb6d87e434","parent":{"id":"9860e9f6-708f-5bc8-a55b-90dec8abd1a0","name":"unorganized","relativePath":"etc/unorganized.md"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1274812890","3935499650","82772122"],"slicesMap":{}}
